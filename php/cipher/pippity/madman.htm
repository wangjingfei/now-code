  <p>Level 14 is all about sound. Therefore, your computer is required to play sound, and you are required to hear sound.<br>
  Due to complaints regarding deaf riddlers and the possibility of people without sound cards, this level has been made optional to complete.<br>

  <p>If you cannot hear sound for whatever reason and would like to progress to level 15, <a href="dissolve.htm">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>
