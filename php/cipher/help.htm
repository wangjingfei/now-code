            <p align="left">Cipher is an online riddle.<br>
              The simple goal in this game is progress through a series of html pages. The challenging part is how this is achieved. Every page will yield a unique puzzle. You must solve this puzzle in order to progress to the next page or &quot;level.&quot; These puzzles will range from dead easy to frustraingly hard, and they will increase in difficulty the higher level that you reach. A very broad range of skills is also required to solve these puzzles, including technology, math, music, science, language, internet smarts, and more. Some levels may require you to use an internet search engine (such as Google), while others will simply require you to use common sense.</p>
            <p align="left">So what are you waiting for? If you have some decent patience and a sharp mind, give it a go!</p>

                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LEVEL 2: </strong>Tried clicking the door? What could be another way to go to a page, other than clicking a link?<br>
                    Think about where you want to go, and go there.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LEVEL 3: </strong>Ever heard of the source code? What does the page title read?<br>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LEVEL 4: </strong>Hmm...1s and 0s? Come on, you must have seen this before...decode the message!<br>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LEVEL 5:</strong> What does the page title read? What is 'darkness'  referring to? The source code could help...<br>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LEVEL 6: </strong>That picture isn't of much help, is it? Checked the source code yet?<br>
                    What's the name of the picture? What can you change to get a different picture?<br>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>LEVEL 7: </strong>You're on your own now, my friend...keep going and don't give up, but never cheat!</li>

              <ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Always check the source code, page title, and picture name. You may find some valuable information!<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>When you find a certain word or decode a certain message, always try entering it into the URL bar with '.htm' at the end.<br>
                    Throughout this riddle, the URL bar will be your answer box. It is the key to advancing through the levels.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>When you solve a level, always bookmark/favourite it. There is no option in this game to &quot;continue your progress,&quot;<br>
                    so you will have to keep track of it on your own by either writing down the answers or saving the page URLs.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Sometimes, solving a puzzle will result in a bunch of letters that, at first, seem useless. In this case (provided you have the correct letters to work with),<br>
                    you may be required to unscramble the letters either by yourself or with an anagram solver program to discover the final answer. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>External programs may sometimes be required to complete a level, especially photo-manipulating programs such as Photoshop.<br>
                    For those who don't have Photoshop, GIMP is a useful alternative/clone (<a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">www.gimp.org</a>). For more info, see the software list provided below. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Some levels include a Google search bar. This means that you most probably will need to use it in order to find the answer,<br>
                    but it may not be necessary, depending on the extent of your knowledge.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>This game was made in Internet Explorer. To date, the riddle has been tested in Google Chrome and also shouldn't have any problems in Firefox.
                    <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>NEVER CHEAT. It takes all the fun out of the game, and it's utterly pointless to just get all the answers off the internet.<br>
                    You could say that you beat the game when you really didn't, so don't lie and carry the guilt.<br>
                  </li>
                  <li>And most of all, be patient. A hard level may make you feel like giving up, but DON'T—just keep going, and remember that the<br>
                  bragging rights for your achievements will  indeed be recognized.</li>
                  <li>Currently, the &quot;reward&quot; for completing Level 50 (the last and most insane level to date) is a password to the winner's forum on the <a href="/forum" target="_blank">Cipher Official Forum</a>,<br>
                    and the addition of their name to the<a href="halloffame.htm" target="_blank"> Hall of Fame</a>. </li>
