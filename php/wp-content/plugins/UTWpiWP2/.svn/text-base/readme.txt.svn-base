||+- header.php includes the php you need to include the name of the tags in 
||   the title bar, if you're looking at a tag page
||+- tag.php is an example of a tag page - the page that is displayed when you
||   select a tag.
||+- searchtags.php is an AJAX driven tag based search.  To use this,  add it 
||   to your theme folder;  then create a new page, and select the "Search Tags"
||   template.  If your wordpress isn't installed at the top level,  you'll 
||   need to tweak the ajax file path.  You might also need to shuffle headers,
||   footers and sidebars about to match your theme.
||+- tags.php is an example of a page template that displays a tag cloud.  As 
     with the tag search,  to use it, you need to create a new page, and select
     the "Tag Archive" template.
